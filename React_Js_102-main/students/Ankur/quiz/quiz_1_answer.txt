JavaScript Quiz-1: 
code: 

	const magic = 42;					// LOC : 1
	const theanswer = magic;				// LOC : 2
	const everything = new Set([magic,theanswer]);	// LOC : 3
	console.log(everything.size);				// LOC : 4
	

Answer : 
	Output: 1.
	Description: at line 3 of the code, a constant set object is created, the set objecy store only unique values of the array passed in as argument. so as we are passing two parameters i.e. magic & theanswer but value of both is 42, so only the value 42 is stored in the set object 'everything' only once.
	
	Now in Line 4 of the code where we are printing 'everthing.size', the size is a prototype of set object which returns the number of elements stored in the object(i.e. in our example 1) so the output is 1
