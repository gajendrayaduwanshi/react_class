JavaScript Quiz-2: 
code: 

	let x = 10;		// LOC 1
	let y = x % 4;		// LOC 2
	let z = y / 2;		// LOC 3
	let c = x * z;		// LOC 4

	alert(x);		// LOC 5
	

Answer : 
	Output: 10.
	Description: as in the question the variable 'x' is decalared and initialized at line 1 of the code with 10, and used further in the code to evaluate other variables but is not being over written or re-initialized so the value of 'x' remains 10 in the whole program, that's why the output is 10.
