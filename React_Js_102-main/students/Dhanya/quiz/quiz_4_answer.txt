//default function declaration
function rectangle(w, h){
    return w * h;
}

//function expression
const rectangle = function(w, h){
    return w * h;
}

//function Arrow expression
const rectangle = (w, h) => {
    return w * h;
}

//shorthand arrow function
const rectangle = (w, h) => w * h;

answer: Output will be shown as "rectangle has alreadt been declared" since Line 7 i.e  function expression as well redefines function rectangle itself.
