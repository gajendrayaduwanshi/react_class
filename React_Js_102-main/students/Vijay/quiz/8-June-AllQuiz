1)

var a=21;
var b=function(){
  console.log(a);
  var a=20;
};

b();

Answer: "Undefined". value for variable a assigned after console. And we can not accept 
         global variable inside any block or function directly, we have to use "global" keyword to do this.
		 
		 

		 
2)
   let x=10;
   let y=x%4;    //gives y=2 as 10%4=2
   let z=y/2;    // gives z=1 as 2/2=1
   let c=x*z;    // gives 10 as 10*1=10
  
   alert(x);  
		 
Answer: 10 as we can re-assign values to any variable which is declare with "let" but we can not re-decalre it.



3)
 const magic = 42;
 const theAnswer = magic;
 
 const everything = new Set([magic, theAnswer]);
 console.log(everything.size);
 
 Answer: "1" as Set method creates ab array or object of unique elements. Here we have value for magic and theAnswer is
          is same that is 42. So, everything.size returns 1 as it gives size of unique values.

   // default function declaration
   function rectangle(w,h){
        return w*h;
   }
   
   // function expression
   const rectangle = function(w,h){
       return w*h;
   }
   
   //function arrow expression
   const rectangle = (w,h)=>{
      return w*h;
   }
   
   //short hand arrow function
   const rectangle = (w,h)=>w*h;
